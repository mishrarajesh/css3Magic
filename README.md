# css3Magic
Using css3 to do things differently.
I am trying to implement the slideUp, SlideDown,SlideToggle of jquery using css3.
How to use:

you can use it exactly the same way like you use the above mentioned jquery functions.
eg:
~~~~~~~~~~~
$('selector').cssSlideDown(1500, function () {
// callback.
});

1500 is here in milliseconds exactly as in jquery.
~~~~~~~~~~
dependency:

Jquery library.
