# css3Magic (v0.01)
Using css3 to do things differently.
I am trying to implement the slideUp, SlideDown,SlideToggle of jquery using css3.
How to use:

you can use it exactly the same way like you use the above mentioned jquery functions.
it has three functions:

cssSlideDown

cssSlideUp

cssSlideToggle

eg:
~~~~~~~~~~~
$('selector').cssSlideDown(1500, function () {
// do things with the element using $(this).

});

1500 is here in milliseconds exactly as in jquery.
~~~~~~~~~~
dependency:

Jquery library.
http://jquery.com/download/

Feel free to use in your projects. Don't foget to give your feedback or suggestions.
